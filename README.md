# Unhandled Error in Asynchronous Node.js Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js server development: insufficient error handling for asynchronous operations.  The `bug.js` file shows a server that performs an asynchronous operation.  If this operation fails, the server doesn't handle the error gracefully, potentially leading to crashes or unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution that implements proper error handling.

## Problem

The provided server lacks a robust mechanism to catch and handle potential errors from the asynchronous function `someAsyncOperation()`. If `someAsyncOperation()` throws an error, the server may crash, or send an incorrect response to the client.

## Solution

The solution involves using appropriate error-handling techniques such as `try...catch` blocks or promises to gracefully manage potential errors within the asynchronous operation.
